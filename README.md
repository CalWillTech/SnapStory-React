# SnapStory-React

Introduction:

Hello, This is a display store for an event photographer company, This project is the 
cumulation of my 3 month learning web development, and I'm proud to be able to post my project.
What I wanted to gain from this project is the basic knowlege React and TailwindCSS, 
the intricitcies and depth of Node's libraries 
(although I try not to overcrowd my project with too many npm packages), 
and the mastery over HTML, CSS, and Javascript. And I have to say, 
after creating 10+ pages, client-side routing, e-commerce website, 
it's a great way to get started. 
If your just starting your coding learning experience, 
or wanted to do more front-end coding without the fear of building an API,
I would suggest creating an e-commerce application.


Functionality:

I purposely made this application as if it were a commercially ran store.
From adding and removing items from your shopping cart, to searching for items in the shop page.

Features are as followed:

Sort and filter through items, selecting size and color of item,
adding and removing items from your cart, and checkout page ready to send data 
to a secure backend Restful-API (Wix, Shopify, etc).

NOTE:
Items in your cart are lost on page refresh.
